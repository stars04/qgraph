# What is this for?
### This program is fun little attempt for me to try to get one project working between two different programming languages
# How does it communicate?
### The goal here was to make the user only interact directly with code executed in java and so, the way the java program and python code interact is through text documents! I'm sure there is a 100% better way to do this, however my goal was to come up with something I could think of on my own without looking anything up, it works! and over various sessions the instructions on java's end are wiped whenever the program is run meaning you can just use the program when you need it, the only catch right now might be with the actual images, although I suspect the program will just overwright images of the same name.

If anyone ever sees it and its usefull, hope you enjoy!!
